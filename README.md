# A Guide to the IB Resources – What do they comprise, how to use them & other things about them

<p>If our site, <a href="https://ibdocuments.com/Home">IB Documents</a> is down please use the <a href="http://ibdocuments.com/">EMERGENCY IB Resources link</a>. Also, you will find resources in our <a href="https://ibresources.github.io/">IB Resources Repository GitHub Page</a>. It’s important to mention that this last one is, again, the main IB Resources Link and you should always look at it first for link updates and status of pages. If ALL servers are currently down, please have patience because we're working on it. Uploading takes time; when new links are ready they'll be posted at the bottom of the GitHub page in the Emergency Links section.</p>

<hr>

<p>What is known by IB Students as the “IB Resources” comprises mainly 10 folders, these being:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>IB Books</p></li>
<li><p>IB Documents</p></li>
<li><p>IB Extended Essay Exemplars</p></li>
<li><p>IB Guides</p></li>

<li><p>IB Past Papers (Organized by Year)</p></li>
<li><p>IB QuestionBanks</p></li>
<li><p>IB Specimen Papers</p></li>
<li><p>IB Subject Reports</p></li>
<li><p>Teacher Support Material (TSM)</p></li>
<li><p>Various IB Useful Documents (Litcharts)</p></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>Briefly, the contents of each one will be described below:</p>

<hr>

<p>1) This one is self-explanatory, mainly there are Books specially prepared for the IB syllabuses of each subject, we could say we have most books for all the mainstream subjects and some for the not-so mainstream ones. Also, there are IB-related miscellaneous books. Always check here before requesting a book. And have in mind that if it’s not already there, it’s most definitely not available. </p>

<hr>

<p>2) In the IB Documents folder you’ll find, in ALL available languages, the (now deprecated) Handbook of Procedures for the Diploma Programme, Forms and Cover Sheets, Answer Booklet Guides, Assessment Access Requirements, Conduct of IB Diploma Programme Examinations, Coordinator's Notes, Data &amp; Formula Booklets, Diploma Program Candidates Documents, Diploma Programme Assessment Procedures, eCourseWork User Guide &amp; Newsletter, Exam Paper Style Samples, Examination Schedules, Examination Sessions Stationery, Examples of New Style Sources, External Whistleblowing Policy, Grade Boundaries, IB Complaints Procedure, IB Financial &amp; Annual Reviews, IB Journal of Teaching Practice, IB PPT Templates, IB Statistical Bulletin, TOP SECRET IB DOCUMENTS - PASSWORD PROTECTED and Use of Calculators in Examinations. Practically everything with some few folder exceptions have been ripped-off from the (now decommissioned) IB OCC (IB Online Curriculum Centre). The most important document which all students should be aware of and should refer to if they have any doubts is aforementioned &#8203;Diploma Programme Assessment Procedures&#8203;, this document has all the information you should know regarding procedures in the DP.</p>

<hr>

<p>3) In the IB Extended Essay Exemplars you’ll find graded (and commented in some cases) Extended Essay Samples from top, middle and low scores (so you know what to do and what not to do). Also, you’ll find the IB Extended Essay Reports which are documents that IB prepares every session in which they point out all the strengths and weaknesses of that session’s Extended Essays. Finally, in this folder are included 3 official IB CD’s containing the following publications: 50 Excellent Extended Essays (2008), 50 More Excellent Extended Essays (2011) and 50 Excellent Theory of Knowledge Essays (2010).</p>

<hr>

<p>4) In the IB Guides folder you’ll find all the available Subject Guides in all available languages, as
provided by IB. IB Guides include the syllabi of a subject including other important details such as assessment information. Essentially any information you (or more likely your teacher) should need for a subject should be found in this document.</p>

<hr>

<p>5) Thanks to a script written in Python by <a href="/u/batmansmaster">/u/batmansmaster</a> we have, organized by subject, all the IB Past Papers and Markschemes.</p>

<hr>

<p>6) These are the all-time known IB Past Papers and Markschemes organized by year, as IB sells them.</p>

<hr>

<p>7) Currently there are 4 versions of QuestionBanks. Versions 1, 2 and 3 are in .exe format meaning you could install it in a Windows PC (or in MAC using third-party software). Version 4 QuestionBanks are now available in a zipped folder; to use it just download the zip, extract it and then click on "index.html", then navigate like any other site, be sure to check the "Important Message". The aforementioned .exe programs and the zip file are available in this folder. The options to sort out questions and create tests are not available due to them being handled only by IB's private servers and it's not possible to activate them.</p>

<p>Basically, in general terms, QuestionBanks are a collection of past questions organized by subject, year, topic and subtopic whose latest version, currently fourth, is an invaluable resource for students to study and practice.</p>

<hr>

<p>8) When the IB changes a syllabus (releases a new guide for a subject) they create Specimen Papers to reflect those changes. The changes include new content being added (like M16 sciences) or the time/mark allocation being changed (M17 HL Mathematics). This is done so that teachers and students, familiarize with what to expect for the syllabus. You’ll find these Specimen Papers in this folder.</p>

<hr>

<p>9) IB Subject Reports are documents that the IB writes after each exam session which are powerful tools that coordinators and teachers use to see, in a very general way, the performance of the students in that exam session. Also, the Grade Boundaries for each subject is shown. You’ll find these documents in this folder in all available languages.</p>

<hr>

<p>10) In the Teacher Support Material (TSM) you'll find mainly Internal Assessments (IAs) graded and commented by external IB examiners. Other relevant (for a teacher) generalities of the subject can be found here as well. These TSM pages are provided in the <a href="https://ibresources.github.io/#ib-teacher-support-material-tsm">GitHub page</a> in all available languages for all available subjects.</p>

<hr>

<p>11) In this folder you’ll find the so-acclaimed LitCharts, which are documents that summarize books in a few pages, presenting everything neatly organized and leaving you ready for the exam (if you were lazy and didn’t read the whole book...).</p>
